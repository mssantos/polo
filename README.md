# Polo

Minimalist REST client for JSON APIs. Run it directly from your browser!

## How to Use

Please install Docker, then follow these steps:

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:readyforproduction/polo.git
> cd polo
> docker compose up --build
```

Now Polo is ready on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Exploring the Code

This project is built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). Most
of the functionality is powered by [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html).

Custom JavaScript is used for the [code editor](https://codemirror.net), though it's kept minimal. While Tailwind is
installed, the styles are primarily written in custom CSS and will remain that way.

## Who is Polo?

The project is named to honor Polo, the God of the Winds and Messenger of Tupã in Tupi-Guarani mythology.
